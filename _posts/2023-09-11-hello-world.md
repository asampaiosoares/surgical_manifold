Hello world!

This is my first entry to this website. I will try to keep it interesting and up to date by sharing research interests and topics related to my clinical practice.

Surgery is said to be more art than science, and surgical research has focused for a long time in observation. This happened because the methods were not adequate and didn't allow the consideration of surgery in its multidimensional version. Surgical procedures are considered almost black boxes into which we as surgeons peer into using the descriptions of our colleagues and the ocasional video and and phtograph. I believe this is just scratching the surface in terms of intraoperative data analysis and that we can do better. I am interested in the application of machine learning and computer vision to surgical data.
